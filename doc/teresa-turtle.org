* NGC 6210

** Original data files
+ [[file:~/Dropbox/Papers/LL-Objects/NGC6210/]]


** Plan of action
+ Follow what I did for the Owl Nebula
  1. Make a median image and then use it to get slit positions
  2. Flux calibration using the median image
  3. At same time find offsets along slit
  4. Add WCS info to PV images
  5. Construct spectral maps (with tetrablock algorithm)


*** Median image
+ We need to add WCS info to all of them
  + [ ] Use astrometry.net
+ Most are Ha + [N II] image + slit
+ ~spm165~ is just an image and is saturated
  + [ ] Fix it - it is wrapping around the integers to negative values, so we just have to add 65536 to the negative pixels
+ Some are [O III] images
+ Others are properly saturated, but one is deep enough to show the halo well
  + ~spm238~ although it has artefacts from the central star
