* NGC 6210

** Basic data on NGC 6210
+ Coordinates
  + (RA, Dec) = (16 44 29.5195973292, +23 47 59.491267229) sexagesimal
  + (RA, Dec) = (251.122998321, 23.7998586853) degrees


** Original data files
+ [[file:~/Dropbox/Papers/LL-Objects/NGC6210/]]


** Plan of action
+ Follow what I did for the Owl Nebula
  1. Make a median image and then use it to get slit positions
  2. Flux calibration using the median image
  3. At same time find offsets along slit
  4. Add WCS info to PV images
  5. Construct spectral maps (with tetrablock algorithm)


*** Median image
+ We need to add WCS info to all of them
  + [ ] Use astrometry.net
+ Most are Ha + [N II] image + slit
+ ~spm165~ is just an image and is saturated
  + [ ] Fix it - it is wrapping around the integers to negative values, so we just have to add 65536 to the negative pixels
+ Some are [O III] images
+ Others are properly saturated, but one is deep enough to show the halo well
  + ~spm238~ although it has artefacts from the central star

**** Astrometry of image+slit exposures
***** First test with astrometry.net
+ Based on what I did with \sigma Ori in [[id:B5B60BC7-5392-4245-93D6-8D17A6B56E5E][WCS solution from command line astrometry.net tools]]
+ Need to find the right index files
  + ICRS coords: 251.1230, 23.7999
  + Annoyingly, this falls at boundary of HEALPIX tiles, so we need ~10~ and ~31~ for the small scales
  + I am just getting scales ~00~ \to ~04~, which covers 2 to 11 arcmin.  Since the FOV is only 5 arcmin, this should be more than enough
  + Downloading from http://data.astrometry.net/5000/
    + The ~00~ scales are the biggest and take 15 min each
  + Copied to [[file:~/Work/astrometry/data/][file:~/Work/astrometry/data/]]
  + What should plate scale be?
    + FOV is 6.5 arcmin from Meaburn:2003a
    + Image size is 1024 pixels in all that I looked at
    + 6.5 60 / 1024 = 0.381 so try the range 0.35 \to 0.4
  + Test command - run in Terminal for safety
    #+begin_src sh :dir ../data/imslit :eval no 
      D=~/Dropbox/Papers/LL-Objects/NGC6210/Temporada2015
      solve-field --ra 251.1230 --dec 23.7999 --radius 1.0 --scale-units arcsecperpix --scale-low 0.35 --scale-high 0.4 --dir . --new-fits '%s-wcs.fits' $D/spm0030o_b.fits 
    #+end_src
  + That worked, but it wrote output to Teresa's shared Dropbox folder
    + Fix it using ~--dir .~ option
    + Try again with ~0035~
    + That worked fine, although the alignment is not perfect
    + If this turns out to be a problem I could try one or more of the following
      1. [X] Use ~--no-tweak~ setting to avoid using SIP polynomial
         - *yes* - that worked much better
         - and there should not be much need for distortion correction since nebula is much smaller than CCD
         - We also need to add ~--overwrite~ option in order to re-do the same image
      2. Maybe increase ~--odds-to-solve~ (default 1e9)
      3. Maybe play with ~--code-tolerance~ or ~--pixel-error~ but I am not sure what these mean (need to read Lang:2010a more carefully).
***** Production run with astrometry.net
+ First, need to get a list of all the image+slit files
****** ~solve-astrometry-imslit.sh~
#+name: imslit-list-2015
+ spm0030
+ spm0035
+ spm0036
+ spm0041

Note that we need to use the ~${var[*]}~ syntax to access whole of array

#+header: :var files=imslit-list-2015
#+begin_src sh :tangle ../scripts/solve-astrometry-imslit.sh
  for f in ${files[*]}; do
      echo $f
  done
#+end_src
